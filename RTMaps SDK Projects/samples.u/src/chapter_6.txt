 * This section demonstrates how to write components that run
 * multiple threads. This is quite rare but can happen in case
 * of interfacing parallel prots in full duplex for example
 * (one thread has to be waiting on a blocking StartReading call to
 * get data on the component input, and a second thread has to be
 * waiting on a blocking call to read incoming data on the bus).
