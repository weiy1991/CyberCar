/*! \defgroup Chapter2 Chapter 2 - Mutliple inputs (IMPORTANT !).
* The vectorizer_sample components demonstrate how to (and how NOT to...) 
* write RTMaps components that have multiple inputs.
* These samples show how to get integer data on several inputs, make a vector,
* and output it.
* This chapter is VERY IMPORTANT for the RTMaps programmer in order to understand
* correctly the different behaviours of the RTMaps inputs (FifoReader,
* SamplingReader, etc...) and the correct ways to use them.
