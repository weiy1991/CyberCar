/*! \defgroup Chapter7 Chapter 7 - Stream.
 * This section demonstrates how to write components that
 * deal with stream data (packets of bytes).
 *
 * maps_rs232sensor.cpp and maps_rs232sensorWithOutput.cpp simply deal with
 * Stream8 typed data (e.g. single packets of bytes), using the usual methods (e.g.
 * StartReading, StartWriting, etc.)
 * 
 * However, sometimes, such stream data contain messages that have to be parsed
 * but the packets may not contain entire messages (a packet can start in the
 * middle of a message, and end in the middel of the next one), hence the
 * need for a way to push the packets into an internal ring buffer, and
 * pop data when a complete message has been exploited.
 * In order to develop such a stream parser component, make a component
 * which inherits from the special "Stream8IOComponentTemplate" and use the 
 * MAPSRBRegion API as demonstrated in 
 * maps_Stream8IOSample.cpp
